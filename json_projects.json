    "description": "85 Viviendas Sociales in Seville is distinguished by its strict orthogonal grid, which organizes both structure and program into a modular, repeating system. By minimizing circulation and eliminating hierarchical room arrangements, the architects created flexible apartments with a rare sense of openness and continuity. Each dwelling benefits from cross ventilation, abundant daylight, and visual depth, making the spaces feel larger and more comfortable while maintaining low energy use. The building encloses a central courtyard, not as a formal focus but as a spatial device that allows all units to open to both sides. Along the inner and outer perimeters, long galleries and terraces act as semi-public extensions of the homes, encouraging interaction and outdoor living while functioning as transitional zones for airflow and light. Structurally, the project employs cross-laminated timber (CLT) walls and beams stacked five stories above a reinforced concrete base—making it the largest CLT residential complex in Spain. Prefabrication and modular assembly reduced construction time, material waste, and labor costs while significantly lowering the building’s carbon footprint. The result is a sustainable, replicable model of social housing that demonstrates how efficiency, comfort, and community can coexist through thoughtful architectural order.",

Developed by EBG, a non-profit cooperative dedicated to socially responsible housing, the project offers units at roughly half the area’s average rent, ensuring accessibility for low-income and disabled residents. The development is composed of seven buildings ranging from four to seven stories, connected by open decks running north–south that encourage daylight, cross-ventilation, and social exchange. Prefabricated timber construction allowed for efficient assembly, reduced waste, and minimal site disturbance. Wood serves as the defining material—renewable, compostable, and gracefully aging—imbuing the ensemble with warmth and identity within the urban context. A staggered arrangement of volumes creates diverse courtyards and visual connections, while carefully cut pathways prevent monotonous corridors. At the heart of the project lies “the canyon,” a two-story communal ring hosting shared facilities, workshops, and gathering spaces that foster interaction among residents. ASP Holzwohnbau Aspern demonstrates how cooperative design can blend affordability, ecological responsibility, and collective life into a contemporary model for sustainable urban housing.",

    "description": "Carrières Centrales in Casablanca, Morocco, designed by French architect and planner Michel Écochard in the early 1950s, was conceived as an emergency housing response to mass displacement during Morocco’s anti-colonial struggles. Following the destruction of shantytowns near European districts and violent crackdowns on labor strikes, nearly 130,000 people were left without shelter. Écochard, then director of urban planning under the French protectorate, proposed a new housing prototype to address what authorities framed as a “sanitary crisis.” His plan introduced an 8×8-meter grid system based on modular courtyard dwellings that combined elements of traditional Moroccan architecture—such as shaded patios and thick walls—with modernist principles of rational planning. The grid allowed for endless permutations of housing clusters, generating diverse courtyards and street conditions within a coherent urban fabric. Though celebrated for its spatial clarity and climatic sensitivity, the project has also been criticized as an instrument of colonial control, designed as much to regulate populations as to house them. Nevertheless, Carrières Centrales established a new architectural language for North African cities—balancing vernacular form, density, and adaptability—and became a key precedent for postcolonial housing experiments worldwide.",

    "description": "Cidade de Deus, or “City of God,” was established in the 1960s as part of a state-led housing initiative in Rio de Janeiro intended to spur economic growth and social reform in Latin America. Conceived as a modernist mass-housing project of 3,053 units designed for around 10,000 residents, it initially featured uniform apartment blocks and neat rows of single-family homes. Over time, however, these planned structures proved inadequate for the community’s growing needs, prompting residents to transform the neighborhood through informal construction. Incremental additions filled the gaps between buildings, creating commercial, social, and residential layers that redefined both form and function. What began as a rigid, state-imposed grid has evolved into a complex and dynamic urban fabric—an ecosystem of self-built structures, evolving property boundaries, and adaptive infrastructures. This process of spontaneous densification, driven by necessity and community agency, produced a heterogeneous landscape that continuously adapts to the lives within it. Cidade de Deus now stands as one of Rio’s most emblematic favelas, a living record of resilience and self-determination that challenges conventional models of top-down urban planning.",

Conceived as a contemporary reinterpretation of the English “garden city,” the project invited five architectural teams—Jean Nouvel, Poitevin & Raynaud, Lewis + Block, Shigeru Ban and De Gastines, and Lacaton & Vassal—to explore new models for affordable yet generous housing. Lacaton & Vassal’s contribution stands out for its radical spatial economy and human-centered design. Each dwelling combines the scale of a house with the affordability of social housing, doubling the typical living volume without increasing cost. The units employ a simple reinforced-concrete frame that supports an elevated platform three meters above grade. Prefabricated horticultural greenhouses with galvanized steel structures and translucent polycarbonate cladding are attached to create adaptable spaces that function as extensions of the home.

The site, once marshland and later the short-lived Freedomland U.S.A. amusement park, was redeveloped beginning in 1966 by the United Housing Foundation under the state’s Mitchell-Lama program to provide affordable housing for middle-income families. Completed in 1973, the project consists of 35 high-rise towers and seven clusters of townhouses totaling more than 15,000 units. Occupying only about 20% of its 320-acre site, the development reserves extensive green space, parks, and pedestrian networks between buildings. To secure an apartment, residents purchased cooperative shares—approximately eighteen shares per room at $25 each—granting ownership and participation in governance. With its efficient land use, large apartment layouts, and accessible ownership model, Co-op City became a prototype for socially inclusive urban housing, maintaining lower poverty and rent-burden rates than the rest of the Bronx while demonstrating how large-scale cooperative planning could balance affordability, community, and livability.",

Fuller is seeking a new method to redesign a dwelling that is adaptable in spaces, and to provide the maximum spaces under the consideration of transportability. The plan of the Dymaxion House is organized with a triangular grid and the furniture is designed based on the triangular form. Besides, the triangle grid is used for dispersing the tension of the structure.\n\n\nThe mechanics of the house involved the use of tension and compression in a web system, which is similar to the idea of suspension bridge. The mast acted as circular support so that all the elements of the building were suspended from above and did not rest upon supports from below. All the mechanical equipment and the supporting system for roof and floor are contained in the mast. By assembling all the fixed elements for the house in the middle, create a maximum occupied space. And the mast avoids the additional supporting system by putting all the heavy equipment in the core. The ventilation is downdraft which reduces the dust in the house. After the air is drawn in from the air inlet to the mast, the central mast circulates the air into the roof and interior by the gaps in the floor panel. Thus the air could ventilate into the rooms from the hole on the floor.\n\n\nThe minimum use of material, the light-weight dwelling, and the self-sufficiency system of ventilation made the Dymaxion House considered also as a sustainable dwelling.",

Additionally, a central atrium features operable openings that adjust to seasonal changes—promoting compactness in winter and openness in summer.\n\n\nAffordability and sustainability in communal housing require active and ongoing resident participation. From the outset, the project was shaped by the ideas of its residents, brought to life by architects and engineers. The initial phase included construction workshops, enabling the community to collectively apply their knowledge and skills to complete the building.
