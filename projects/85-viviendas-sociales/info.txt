title: 85 Viviendas Sociales
location: Sevilla, Spain
description:
85 Viviendas Sociales in Seville is distinguished by its strict orthogonal grid, which organizes both structure and program into a modular, repeating system. By minimizing circulation and eliminating hierarchical room arrangements, the architects created flexible apartments with a rare sense of openness and continuity. Each dwelling benefits from cross ventilation, abundant daylight, and visual depth, making the spaces feel larger and more comfortable while maintaining low energy use. The building encloses a central courtyard, not as a formal focus but as a spatial device that allows all units to open to both sides. Along the inner and outer perimeters, long galleries and terraces act as semi-public extensions of the homes, encouraging interaction and outdoor living while functioning as transitional zones for airflow and light. Structurally, the project employs cross-laminated timber (CLT) walls and beams stacked five stories above a reinforced concrete base—making it the largest CLT residential complex in Spain. Prefabrication and modular assembly reduced construction time, material waste, and labor costs while significantly lowering the building’s carbon footprint. The result is a sustainable, replicable model of social housing that demonstrates how efficiency, comfort, and community can coexist through thoughtful architectural order.
