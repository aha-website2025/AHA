title: 85 Viviendas Sociales
location: Sevilla, Spain
description:
85 Viviendas Sociales in Seville is defined by its strict orthogonal grid, which organizes both structure and program into a modular, repeating system. By minimizing circulation and removing hierarchy between rooms, the architects created flexible apartments with an unusual sense of openness and continuity. Each unit benefits from cross ventilation, daylight, and visual depth, making spaces feel larger and more comfortable while maintaining low energy use. The building frames a central courtyard, not as a formal focus but as a spatial device that allows all dwellings to open to both sides. Along its inner and outer edges, long galleries and terraces act as semi-public extensions of the homes, encouraging interaction and outdoor living while improving airflow and light. The project employs cross-laminated timber (CLT) walls and beams over a reinforced concrete base, forming Spain’s largest CLT housing complex. Prefabrication and modular assembly reduced construction time, waste, and cost, offering a replicable model where efficiency, comfort, and community coexist.
