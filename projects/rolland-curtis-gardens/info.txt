location: Los Angeles, USA
description:
Rolland Curtis Gardens in South Los Angeles is a community-driven, mixed-use, and transit-oriented development that demonstrates how affordable housing can integrate sustainability and social equity. Located near the Expo Line, the project provides 140 affordable apartments alongside 8,000 square feet of ground-floor retail and community-serving spaces. Originally built in the 1980s, the property faced threats of displacement when the previous owner sought to convert it into student housing. In response, T.R.U.S.T. South LA partnered with Abode Communities to purchase and redevelop the site through a collaborative six-month planning process that placed tenants and neighbors at the center of decision-making. Completed in 2017, the revitalized complex offers family-oriented apartments, shared courtyards, community rooms, and gardens that promote mobility, safety, and belonging. Green building strategies such as energy-efficient systems, drought-tolerant landscaping, and stormwater management reduce environmental impact while lowering utility costs for residents. Rolland Curtis Gardens exemplifies inclusive urban development in Los Angeles by preserving affordability, enhancing access to public transit, and ensuring that long-term residents remain active participants in shaping their neighborhood’s future.
