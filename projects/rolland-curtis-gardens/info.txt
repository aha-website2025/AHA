description:
Rolland Curtis Gardens in South Los Angeles is a community-driven, mixed-use, transit-oriented development that shows how affordable housing can integrate sustainability and social equity. Located next to the Expo Line, the project provides 140 affordable apartments with 8,000 square feet of ground-floor retail and community spaces. Originally built in the 1980s, the property faced displacement pressures when the former owner sought conversion to student housing. In response, T.R.U.S.T. South LA partnered with Abode Communities to acquire and redevelop the site through a collaborative planning process centered on tenant and neighborhood participation. Completed in 2017, the renewed complex includes family-oriented units, shared courtyards, and gardens that promote safety and belonging. Green strategies such as energy-efficient systems, drought-tolerant landscaping, and stormwater management reduce environmental impact and utility costs. Rolland Curtis Gardens exemplifies inclusive urban development that preserves affordability, strengthens transit access, and ensures long-term residents remain engaged in shaping their community.
