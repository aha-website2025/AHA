title: Genossenschaft Kalkbreite
location: Zurich, Switzerland
description:
Kalkbreite in Zurich is a landmark example of cooperative housing that merges density, community, and sustainability within a single urban block. Built above an active tram depot, the project transforms an infrastructural void into a vibrant urban hub that integrates residential, commercial, and public programs. The complex includes 97 units housing around 250 residents, along with offices, restaurants, and cultural spaces that serve both the cooperative and the wider neighborhood. At its center, a landscaped courtyard open to the public forms a shared green heart that connects residents and visitors while reducing noise and pollution from the surrounding streets. The architecture combines prefabricated timber with exposed steel framing, giving the building a robust yet warm industrial character. Communal kitchens, workshops, laundry rooms, and rooftop gardens promote social exchange and collective care. Governed through democratic decision-making, Kalkbreite shows how cooperative development can unite livability, affordability, and ecology in Zurich’s tradition of inclusive city-making.
