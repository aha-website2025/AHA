description:
Kalkbreite in Zurich is a mixed-use cooperative housing complex that functions as a lively district hub. Built above a tram depot, it integrates residential, commercial, and public spaces within a single urban block. The courtyard, accessible to the public, offers a green communal heart that connects residents and visitors while buffering noise from the streets. Prefabricated wood elements and exposed steel frames give the building a distinctive industrial character. With shared facilities, shops, and restaurants, Kalkbreite demonstrates how cooperative development can foster urban density, affordability, and community-oriented living in the center of the city.
