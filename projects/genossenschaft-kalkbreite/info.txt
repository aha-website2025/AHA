title: Genossenschaft Kalkbreite
location: Zurich, Switzerland
model: cooperative
description:
Kalkbreite in Zurich is a landmark example of cooperative housing that merges density, community, and sustainability within a single urban block. Built above an active tram depot, the project transforms an infrastructural void into a vibrant district hub that integrates residential, commercial, and public programs. The complex contains 97 units, housing about 250 residents, alongside offices, restaurants, and cultural venues that serve both the cooperative and the broader neighborhood. At its center lies a landscaped courtyard open to the public, creating a shared green heart that connects residents and visitors while reducing noise and pollution from the surrounding streets. The architecture combines prefabricated timber elements with exposed steel framing, giving the building a robust yet warm industrial character. Generous communal spaces—kitchens, laundry rooms, workshops, and rooftop gardens—encourage social interaction and collective care. Governed through democratic decision-making, Kalkbreite demonstrates how cooperative development can achieve urban livability, long-term affordability, and ecological responsibility while reinforcing Zurich’s tradition of inclusive city-building.
