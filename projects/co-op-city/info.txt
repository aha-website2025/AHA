location: Bronx, USA
description:
Co-op City in the Bronx, New York, stands as the largest cooperative housing development in the world and a lasting embodiment of the Rochdale Principles of Cooperation (1844), later formalized by the International Cooperative Alliance in 1937. The site, once marshland and later the short-lived Freedomland U.S.A. amusement park, was redeveloped beginning in 1966 by the United Housing Foundation under the state’s Mitchell-Lama program to provide affordable housing for middle-income families. Completed in 1973, the project consists of 35 high-rise towers and seven clusters of townhouses totaling more than 15,000 units. Occupying only about 20% of its 320-acre site, the development reserves extensive green space, parks, and pedestrian networks between buildings. To secure an apartment, residents purchased cooperative shares—approximately eighteen shares per room at $25 each—granting ownership and participation in governance. With its efficient land use, large apartment layouts, and accessible ownership model, Co-op City became a prototype for socially inclusive urban housing, maintaining lower poverty and rent-burden rates than the rest of the Bronx while demonstrating how large-scale cooperative planning could balance affordability, community, and livability.
