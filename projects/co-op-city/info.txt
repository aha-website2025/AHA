location: Bronx, USA
description:
Co-op City in the Bronx, New York, is the world’s largest cooperative housing development and a lasting expression of the Rochdale Principles of Cooperation (1844), later formalized by the International Cooperative Alliance in 1937. The site, once marshland and later the short-lived Freedomland U.S.A. amusement park, was redeveloped beginning in 1966 by the United Housing Foundation under New York State’s Mitchell-Lama program to provide affordable housing for middle-income families. Completed in 1973, the project comprises 35 high-rise towers and seven clusters of townhouses totaling more than 15,000 units. Occupying only 20 percent of its 320-acre site, the development preserves generous green space, parks, and pedestrian routes between buildings. Residents purchase cooperative shares, about eighteen per room at twenty-five dollars each, granting both ownership and participation in governance. With its efficient land use, spacious layouts, and accessible ownership model, Co-op City remains a prototype for socially inclusive urban housing that balances affordability, community, and livability.
