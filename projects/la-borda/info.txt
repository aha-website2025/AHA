description: La Borda is a cooperative housing project in Barcelona developed in response to the region's housing shortage. The cooperative is built on land owned by the City Council, granted for 75 years for state-subsidized housing. This arrangement allowed local residents to collaborate with architects from Lacol and other consultants to establish a 28-unit sustainable housing complex. The community prioritized three core principles in its development: economic and environmental sustainability, cooperation through community participation, and the advancement of communal living.
