title: La Borda
location: Barcelona, Spain
description:
La Borda in Barcelona is a cooperative housing project developed as a grassroots response to the city’s housing crisis and rising cost of living. Created by the residents’ cooperative in collaboration with the architectural collective Lacol, it occupies land leased from the Barcelona City Council for 75 years through a public and cooperative partnership. The building provides 28 affordable, energy-efficient units arranged around shared spaces that promote collective life. Guided from the outset by principles of economic sustainability, environmental responsibility, and participatory design, La Borda is among the tallest timber structures in Spain, built with cross-laminated timber (CLT) to reduce embodied carbon and streamline construction. A central atrium mediates light, air, and temperature, minimizing energy demand. Communal facilities such as a kitchen, laundry, workshops, and rooftop terrace support daily interaction and shared labor. Every aspect, from material selection to governance, was decided collectively, making La Borda a model of democratic, low-carbon urban housing rooted in solidarity.
