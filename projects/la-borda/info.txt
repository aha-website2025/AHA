location: Barcelona, Spain
description:
La Borda is a cooperative housing project in Barcelona created as a grassroots response to the city’s housing crisis and rising cost of living. Developed by the residents’ cooperative in collaboration with the architectural collective Lacol, the project occupies land leased from the Barcelona City Council for 75 years under a public and cooperative partnership. It provides 28 affordable, energy-efficient units organized around shared spaces that promote collective life. From its inception, La Borda was guided by three core principles: economic and environmental sustainability, participatory design, and community-based living. The six-story timber structure is among the tallest wooden buildings in Spain, using cross-laminated timber (CLT) to reduce embodied carbon and simplify construction. A central atrium functions as a climatic mediator, using natural ventilation and solar gain to minimize energy demand throughout the year. Multi-purpose communal areas such as a laundry room, kitchen, workshops, and rooftop terrace reduce redundancy and foster daily interaction. Every decision, from material choice to governance, emerged through resident assemblies and collective labor. La Borda stands as a model of cooperative urbanism, proving that democratic design can produce affordable, low-carbon housing rooted in solidarity and shared stewardship.
