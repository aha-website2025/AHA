description:
Star Apartments in downtown Los Angeles, designed by Michael Maltzan Architecture for the Skid Row Housing Trust, is a pioneering model of permanent supportive housing that redefines urban density and social care. Completed in 2014, the six-story, 95,000-square-foot development provides 102 modular units for formerly homeless residents alongside spaces for health services, recreation, and community engagement. The prefabricated housing modules were constructed off-site and craned onto a concrete podium that houses retail, offices, and a health clinic, reducing construction waste and time. Above, a series of terraced roofs and shared courtyards create open-air gathering spaces that promote physical activity, social interaction, and emotional well-being. The building’s striking, cantilevered form symbolizes the uplifting mission of the Skid Row Housing Trust—to replace isolation with dignity and community. Achieving LEED Platinum certification, Star Apartments integrates sustainable materials, efficient systems, and natural ventilation, demonstrating how innovative architecture can merge modular construction, social infrastructure, and design excellence to foster inclusive, resilient urban living.
