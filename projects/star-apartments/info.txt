description:
Star Apartments in downtown Los Angeles, designed by Michael Maltzan Architecture for the Skid Row Housing Trust, is a pioneering model of permanent supportive housing that redefines urban density and social care. Completed in 2014, the six-story, 95,000-square-foot complex provides 102 modular units for formerly homeless residents along with spaces for health services, recreation, and community life. The prefabricated modules were built off-site and lifted onto a concrete podium containing retail, offices, and a health clinic, reducing construction time and waste. Above, terraced roofs and open courtyards form communal spaces that encourage activity, interaction, and well-being. The building’s cantilevered form embodies the Trust’s mission to replace isolation with dignity and connection. Achieving LEED Platinum certification, Star Apartments combines sustainable materials, efficient systems, and natural ventilation, showing how architecture can unite modular construction, social infrastructure, and design quality to promote inclusive and resilient urban living.
