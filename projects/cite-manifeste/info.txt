description:
These 14 single-family houses designed by Lacaton & Vassal are part of Cite Manifeste, a collection of 61 high-quality apartments constructed for average-income residents. Cite Manifeste was commissioned by SOMCO, an organization founded during the industrial revolution to address poor living conditions of urban workers. Their solution was a residential complex based on the English “garden city” model. Five teams of architects were invited to contribute to this project, including Jean Nouvel, Poitevin & Raynaud, Lewis + Block, Lacaton & Vassal, Shigeru Ban, and De Gastines.


Of the five architects, the 14 dwellings by Lacaton & Vassal gained the most international recognition for its efficient use of space and radical design. Lacaton & Vassal aimed to design quality houses that are larger, more comfortable, more flexible, and cost-effective than conventional social housing. As a result, the volume of the space is almost double that of the usual standard in social housing. The loft-like layout of the units offer a high degree of flexibility and customization. The structure is a simple reinforced concrete post and beam structure which supports an elevated platform at 3 meters height. Horticultural greenhouses with galvanized steel frames and transparent polycarbonate walls are then fixed on the platform. The greenhouses are split into isolated and heated indoor sections and semi-outdoor “winter gardens”.
