location: Mulhouse, France
description:
Cité Manifeste – Lacaton & Vassal in Mulhouse, France, consists of fourteen single-family houses within a sixty-one-unit development commissioned by SOMCO, a historic social housing association founded during the industrial revolution to improve workers’ living conditions. Conceived as a contemporary reinterpretation of the English garden city, the project invited five architectural teams—Jean Nouvel, Poitevin & Raynaud, Lewis + Block, Shigeru Ban and De Gastines, and Lacaton & Vassal—to test new models for affordable yet generous housing. Lacaton & Vassal’s contribution is noted for its radical spatial economy and human-centered approach. Each dwelling combines the scale of a house with the affordability of social housing, doubling living volume without higher cost. A reinforced-concrete frame supports an elevated platform three meters above ground, with prefabricated greenhouses of galvanized steel and translucent polycarbonate attached as adaptable extensions. These winter gardens blur interior and exterior, providing light, flexibility, and energy efficiency while redefining the potential of low-cost housing.
