location: Mulhouse, France
description:
The fourteen single-family houses by Lacaton & Vassal form part of Cité Manifeste in Mulhouse, France, a development of sixty-one dwellings commissioned by SOMCO, a historic social housing association originally founded during the industrial revolution to improve workers’ living conditions. Conceived as a contemporary reinterpretation of the English “garden city,” the project invited five architectural teams—Jean Nouvel, Poitevin & Raynaud, Lewis + Block, Shigeru Ban and De Gastines, and Lacaton & Vassal—to explore new models for affordable yet generous housing. Lacaton & Vassal’s contribution stands out for its radical spatial economy and human-centered design. Each dwelling combines the scale of a house with the affordability of social housing, doubling the typical living volume without increasing cost. The units employ a simple reinforced-concrete frame that supports an elevated platform three meters above grade. Prefabricated horticultural greenhouses with galvanized steel structures and translucent polycarbonate cladding are attached to create adaptable spaces that function as extensions of the home. These winter gardens blur the boundary between interior and exterior, offering flexibility, daylight, and energy efficiency while redefining what low-cost housing can achieve.
