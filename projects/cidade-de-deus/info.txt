title: Cidade de Deus
location: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
description:
Cidade de Deus, or “City of God,” was established in the 1960s as part of a state-led housing initiative in Rio de Janeiro aimed at stimulating economic growth and social reform in Latin America. Conceived as a modernist mass-housing project of 3,053 units for about 10,000 residents, it originally featured uniform apartment blocks and orderly rows of single-family homes. Over time, these planned structures proved insufficient for the community’s evolving needs, prompting residents to transform the neighborhood through informal construction. Incremental additions filled gaps between buildings, forming commercial, social, and residential layers that redefined both form and function. What began as a rigid, state-imposed grid evolved into a complex urban fabric shaped by self-built structures, shifting property lines, and adaptive infrastructures. This process of spontaneous densification, driven by necessity and collective agency, created a heterogeneous landscape that continues to adapt to daily life. Cidade de Deus stands today as one of Rio’s most emblematic favelas, a record of resilience and self-determination that challenges top-down urban planning.
