description:
Cidade de Deus, or “City of God,” began as a predefined, mass housing project built in Rio de Janeiro in the 1960s with the aim to promote economic growth and political reform in Latin America. The formerly sterile, uniform layout has informally grown over the span of multiple decades to accommodate a growing population, activating the spaces between and around the original housing units and apartment blocks. The informal construction undertaken by its citizens has generated a heterogeneous structure that, although it is recognizable as a whole, is composed of hyper-specific, continuously transforming space. Rather than creating specific structures to mold into specific categories, an open catalog of construction technologies, production modes, financial means, programmatic evolution, popular aesthetics, etc., has been and is being employed on a regular basis to conscientiously evolve with Cidade de Deus’s residents.


Although this basis of the city was composed of similar housing and apartment units arranged in neat rows and blocks, they are now barely recognizable — or even visible — within the informally built extensions. Originally, 3,053 units were built to house a planned 10,000 people. Because the initial structures were not properly suited towards holding this many citizens, much less acting as collective housing, Cidade de Deus’s residents modified their spatial configuration on their own. They filled in the space between the early housing units with layered commercial and social spaces and structures and transformed the single family homes into multi-story, multi-generational ones, eventually building the city into one of the most famous favelas and urban sub-centers of Rio de Janeiro.
