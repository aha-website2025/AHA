location: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
description:
Cidade de Deus, or “City of God,” was established in the 1960s as part of a state-led housing initiative in Rio de Janeiro intended to spur economic growth and social reform in Latin America. Conceived as a modernist mass-housing project of 3,053 units designed for around 10,000 residents, it initially featured uniform apartment blocks and neat rows of single-family homes. Over time, however, these planned structures proved inadequate for the community’s growing needs, prompting residents to transform the neighborhood through informal construction. Incremental additions filled the gaps between buildings, creating commercial, social, and residential layers that redefined both form and function. What began as a rigid, state-imposed grid has evolved into a complex and dynamic urban fabric—an ecosystem of self-built structures, evolving property boundaries, and adaptive infrastructures. This process of spontaneous densification, driven by necessity and community agency, produced a heterogeneous landscape that continuously adapts to the lives within it. Cidade de Deus now stands as one of Rio’s most emblematic favelas, a living record of resilience and self-determination that challenges conventional models of top-down urban planning.
