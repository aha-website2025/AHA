title: Dillon 617
location: Los Angeles, CA
description:
Over the past two decades, Silverlake has transformed into a dense, socially diverse neighborhood, creating demand for affordable housing. The Dillon 617 apartments address this through architecture that blends communal and private spaces within a compact urban form. A dark metal exterior contrasts with a bright white interior centered around a “paseo” walkway that links terraces, multi-tenant units, amenities, and green communal areas. Adapting to a tight infill site, the design maximizes openness and interaction, offering residents a strong sense of community and connection to the environment.
