location: Casablanca, Morocco
description:
Carrières Centrales in Casablanca, Morocco, designed by French architect and planner Michel Écochard in the early 1950s, was conceived as an emergency housing response to mass displacement during Morocco’s anti-colonial struggles. Following the destruction of shantytowns near European districts and violent crackdowns on labor strikes, nearly 130,000 people were left without shelter. Écochard, then director of urban planning under the French protectorate, proposed a new housing prototype to address what authorities framed as a “sanitary crisis.” His plan introduced an 8×8-meter grid system based on modular courtyard dwellings that combined elements of traditional Moroccan architecture—such as shaded patios and thick walls—with modernist principles of rational planning. The grid allowed for endless permutations of housing clusters, generating diverse courtyards and street conditions within a coherent urban fabric. Though celebrated for its spatial clarity and climatic sensitivity, the project has also been criticized as an instrument of colonial control, designed as much to regulate populations as to house them. Nevertheless, Carrières Centrales established a new architectural language for North African cities—balancing vernacular form, density, and adaptability—and became a key precedent for postcolonial housing experiments worldwide.
