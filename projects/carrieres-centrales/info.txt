title: Carrieres Centrales
location: Casablanca, Morocco
description:
Carrières Centrales in Casablanca, Morocco, designed by French architect and planner Michel Écochard in the early 1950s, was conceived as an emergency housing response to mass displacement during Morocco’s anti-colonial struggles. Following the destruction of shantytowns near European districts and violent crackdowns on labor strikes, nearly 130,000 people were left without shelter. Écochard, then director of urban planning under the French protectorate, proposed a housing prototype to address what authorities called a sanitary crisis. His plan introduced an 8×8-meter grid of modular courtyard dwellings that combined shaded patios and thick walls with modernist principles of rational planning. The grid allowed permutations of housing clusters, generating varied courtyards and street conditions within a unified fabric. Though celebrated for clarity and climatic logic, the project was also criticized as colonial regulation disguised as reform. Still, Carrières Centrales shaped a new architectural language for North Africa, balancing vernacular form, density, and adaptability.
