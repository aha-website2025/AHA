description:
Grundbau und Siedler in Hamburg, completed in 2013, is an experimental cooperative housing project that offers affordable, self-built units for working-class residents seeking relief from rising rents. Designed by BeL Sozietät für Architektur, it combines a robust shared framework with individual freedom of construction. The ground floor accommodates workshops, parking, and a lobby, while four upper levels contain three flexible units each with generous 10.5-foot ceilings. Unit sizes range from 98 to 490 square feet and are sold as bare shells that residents complete themselves according to need and budget. Future occupants receive a kit of parts with materials, manuals, and professional training. Wide staircases and a freight elevator simplify material transport, allowing residents to customize their homes with minimal technical barriers. Surveys revealed two layout types: one fluid and open, the other more traditional with defined rooms. In both, flexibility and self-determination remain central. The project shows how cooperative frameworks can unite affordability, craftsmanship, and community in urban housing.
