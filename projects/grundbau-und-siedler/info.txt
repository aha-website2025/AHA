title: Grundbau Und Siedler
location: Hamburg, Germany
description:
Completed in 2013 in Hamburg, Grundbau und Siedler is an experimental cooperative housing project that offers affordable, self-build units for working-class residents seeking relief from rising rents. Designed by BeL Sozietät für Architektur, the project combines a robust shared framework with individual freedom of construction. The ground floor accommodates workshops, parking, and a lobby, while four upper floors contain three flexible units each, with generous 10.5-foot ceiling heights. Unit sizes range from 98 to 490 square feet, sold as bare “shells” that residents complete themselves according to need and budget. Future occupants purchase a kit of parts that includes construction materials, a detailed manual, and professional training. Wide staircases and a freight elevator allow easy material transport, enabling residents to customize their homes with minimal technical barriers. Surveys revealed two common layout approaches: one fluid, without hallways, where rooms merge through movable partitions, and another more traditional, defined by discrete rooms and shared open areas. In both, flexibility and personal agency remain central. Grundbau und Siedler demonstrates how open building systems and cooperative frameworks can merge affordability, craftsmanship, and community within contemporary urban housing.
