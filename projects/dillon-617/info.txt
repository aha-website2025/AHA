description:
Dillon 617 in Silver Lake, Los Angeles, designed by Lorcan O’Herlihy Architects, transforms a narrow infill lot into a vibrant, community-oriented housing development that redefines urban density. The project consists of two elongated building bars connected by an open-air pedestrian paseo that organizes circulation while bringing daylight, air, and social life deep into the site. This central corridor serves as a shared spine, part pathway and part communal space, encouraging informal interaction among residents. The exterior is clad in dark metal panels that give the building a strong urban presence, contrasting with luminous white interiors that reflect light into the narrow spaces between volumes. Apartments feature cross ventilation and flexible layouts to maximize efficiency within a compact footprint. The design integrates terraces, courtyards, and layered visual connections that balance privacy and community. Through material economy, formal clarity, and social intent, Dillon 617 shows how architecture can elevate affordable, high-density housing into an experience of openness and belonging in the city.
