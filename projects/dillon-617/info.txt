description:
Located in Silver Lake, Dillon 617 by Lorcan Oâ€™Herlihy Architects transforms a narrow infill site into a dense yet livable community. Two parallel building bars are linked by a bright, open paseo that encourages social interaction while providing light and ventilation. A dark metal exterior contrasts with luminous white interiors, defining a rhythm of private and communal spaces. Within its compact footprint, the project balances affordability, spatial efficiency, and design clarity, demonstrating how thoughtful architecture can foster community, sustainability, and urban density without sacrificing livability.
