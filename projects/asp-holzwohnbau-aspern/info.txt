description:
ASP Holzwohnbau Aspern in Vienna is a mixed-use cooperative housing project that integrates sustainability at economic, social, and environmental levels. Developed by EBG, a non-profit cooperative dedicated to socially responsible housing, the project offers units at roughly half the area’s average rent, ensuring accessibility for low-income and disabled residents. The development is composed of seven buildings ranging from four to seven stories, connected by open decks running north–south that encourage daylight, cross-ventilation, and social exchange. Prefabricated timber construction allowed for efficient assembly, reduced waste, and minimal site disturbance. Wood serves as the defining material—renewable, compostable, and gracefully aging—imbuing the ensemble with warmth and identity within the urban context. A staggered arrangement of volumes creates diverse courtyards and visual connections, while carefully cut pathways prevent monotonous corridors. At the heart of the project lies “the canyon,” a two-story communal ring hosting shared facilities, workshops, and gathering spaces that foster interaction among residents. ASP Holzwohnbau Aspern demonstrates how cooperative design can blend affordability, ecological responsibility, and collective life into a contemporary model for sustainable urban housing.
