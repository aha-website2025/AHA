description:
ASP Holzwohnbau Aspern in Vienna is a mixed-use cooperative housing project that integrates sustainability across economic, social, and environmental dimensions. Developed by EBG, a non-profit cooperative focused on socially responsible housing, the project offers units at roughly half the area’s average rent, ensuring accessibility for low-income and disabled residents. The complex consists of seven buildings from four to seven stories, connected by open decks running north to south that promote daylight, cross ventilation, and social interaction. Prefabricated timber construction enabled efficient assembly, reduced waste, and limited site disturbance. Wood, both renewable and compostable, defines the ensemble with warmth and identity in the urban fabric. A staggered arrangement of volumes forms courtyards and visual links, while carefully cut pathways prevent monotony. At its core, “the canyon” is a two-story communal ring with shared facilities and workshops that foster interaction. The project shows how cooperative design can unite affordability, ecology, and collective life in a modern urban model.
