description:
ASP Holzwohnbau Aspern in Vienna is a mixed-use cooperative housing project that integrates sustainability across economic, social, and environmental dimensions. Developed by EBG, a non-profit cooperative focused on socially responsible housing, the project offers units at roughly half the area’s average rent, ensuring accessibility for low-income and disabled residents. The complex consists of seven buildings from four to seven stories, connected by open decks running north to south that promote daylight, cross ventilation, and social interaction. Prefabricated timber construction enabled efficient assembly, reduced waste, and minimal site disturbance. Wood is the defining material—renewable, compostable, and gracefully aging—giving the ensemble warmth and identity within the urban fabric. A staggered arrangement of volumes forms diverse courtyards and visual links, while carefully cut pathways prevent monotonous corridors. At its center lies “the canyon,” a two-story communal ring with shared facilities, workshops, and gathering spaces that foster interaction. The project shows how cooperative design can merge affordability, ecology, and collective life in a contemporary urban model.
