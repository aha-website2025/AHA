    "description": "Cooperative housing is a resident-owned and democratically governed model where individuals hold shares in a cooperative corporation that owns the entire property. In return, each member is granted the right to occupy a specific unit and participate in the governance of the co-op. The highest authority is the general membership (or general assembly), which operates on a one-member-one-vote basis and elects a board of directors to make strategic decisions and oversee management. The board hires and supervises a management team responsible for day-to-day operations such as maintenance, rent collection, and administration. Additionally, many co-ops establish committees made up of volunteers to focus on specific areas like admissions, repairs, community events, or sustainability. The structure is designed to foster democratic governance, shared responsibility, and collective ownership, often with a focus on long-term affordability and community well-being.",
