The Affordable Housing Atlas is a growing digital catalogue that documents innovative housing projects from around the world, highlighting alternative models of affordability, ownership, and community life. Using research and architectural drawings produced by students at the University of Southern California, it examines how financial structures, materials, and social systems shape housing as a shared resource. Each case study reveals links between design, policy, and participation, showing how architecture can advance equity, sustainability, and collective well-being in the built environment.
