The Affordable Housing Atlas is a growing digital catalogue that documents innovative housing projects from around the world, highlighting alternative models of affordability, ownership, and community building. Using research and architectural drawings produced by students at the University of Southern California, it explores how financial structures, materials, and social systems influence the production of housing as a shared resource. Each case study reveals the relationship between design, policy, and community participation, demonstrating how architecture can promote equity, sustainability, and collective well-being in the built environment and beyond.
