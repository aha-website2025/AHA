Sascha Delz is an architect and researcher working at the intersection of architecture, urban design, and urban studies. Engaging with contemporary urbanization processes, his research focuses on how specific political-economic frameworks influence the manifestation of architecture, urban form and living environments. Addressing challenges of uneven development, asymmetric cooperation setups, and exclusive distribution of urban resources, he aims at advancing knowledge on more equitable and collaborative practices of urban production in general, and on non-profit models of adequate and affordable housing in particular. 

As an assistant professor at the University of Southern California, Sascha focuses on collective and co-operative models for urban housing, infrastructure, and services that can potentially create more inclusive and sustainable urban environments. He holds a master’s degree in Architecture and a Doctor of Science from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich). He is the co-editor and co-author of the 2020 publication <Housing the Co-op – A Micropolitical Manifesto> (Ruby Press).
