title: Model A
description: Model A is a mixed-equity financing model that blends public subsidies with member investment to ensure long-term affordability. Under this system, the initial development is funded through a combination of low-interest public loans, municipal land leases, and resident share purchases that grant occupancy and voting rights. Members pay monthly fees covering operating costs and debt service, while equity growth is limited to prevent speculation. This structure stabilizes housing costs and keeps units permanently affordable, even as market prices rise. By aligning collective ownership with financial sustainability, Model A enables residents to build community wealth without privatizing shared assets.
