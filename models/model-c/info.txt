title: Model C
category: cooperative
description: Cooperative housing is a resident-owned and democratically governed model in which individuals hold shares in a cooperative corporation that collectively owns the entire property. Instead of owning individual units, members are granted the right to occupy a specific dwelling and actively participate in the governance and decision-making of the cooperative. The highest authority within this structure is the general assembly, composed of all members, which operates on a one-member-one-vote basis to ensure equality in representation. The assembly elects a board of directors responsible for setting policies, managing finances, and overseeing long-term planning, while the board hires and supervises a professional management team to handle daily operations such as maintenance, budgeting, rent collection, and community coordination. Many cooperatives also form committees dedicated to specific issues such as sustainability, building maintenance, admissions, and social programming. Through this structure, co-ops cultivate democratic participation, collective ownership, and social cohesion, promoting long-term affordability, stability, and mutual care among residents.
