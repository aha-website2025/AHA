title: Model B
category: cooperative
description: Cooperative housing is a resident-owned and democratically governed model where individuals hold shares in a cooperative corporation that owns the entire property. Members gain the right to occupy specific units and participate in governance through a general assembly operating on a one-member-one-vote basis. The assembly elects a board of directors to oversee policy, finances, and management, while committees address areas like maintenance, sustainability, or community events. This structure promotes collective ownership, shared responsibility, and long-term affordability, emphasizing cooperation, stability, and community well-being over profit.
