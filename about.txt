The Affordable Housing Atlas is a digital catalogue that compiles global examples of innovative and equitable housing. Using research and architectural drawings produced by students at the University of Southern California, the Atlas documents how diverse financial, material, and organizational models can foster affordability and community. Each case study highlights the relationship between design and social systems, revealing how architecture can serve as a tool for collective well-being rather than speculation. Through comparative mapping and visual analysis, the project reimagines housing as an essential civic infrastructure grounded in cooperation, sustainability, and inclusivity.
