    "description": "Carrières Centrales represents a series of housing located in Casablanca, Morocco designed for factory workers and locals from rural work areas within the city. French architect (and urban planner) Michel Ecochard was brought in to develop emergency housing due to mass displacement caused by local strikes and liberation struggles against French colonialistic occupation during the 1930s through the mid-1950s. Two events, in particular, rapidly escalated the situation into a humanitarian crisis that ultimately left around 130,000 people displaced from their neighborhoods and cities. The first event revolves around French authorities destroying a multitude of shanty towns located near “European quarters” behind the scapegoat of a typhoid epidemic spreading throughout the region. The other critical moment comes in the form of a two-day “mouse strike” organized by the Moroccan Worker Union Confederation (UGSCM) and their respective nationalist party, Istiqlal, where participants simply refused to leave home to go to work. This led to some tension between them and the French police that was attempting to end the strike, ultimately leading to the police shooting anyone who was either defensive or refusing to leave their homes.\n\n\nMany consider the Carrières Centrales project to not be an actual response to major issues happening at the time. Rather, they consider it to be Ecochard’s way of attempting to shut down the anti-colonial movement by appeasing the demands and needs of the civilians affected. This claim is evident in the design choices and style created to use as a template for the whole project. Essentially the project revolves around the use of a linear 8 x 8-meter grid plan that was based on a patio dwelling unit where aesthetically it would blend some French mediums and the local Moroccan style into one. From here each unit could be rearranged into various configurations that would help to create different courtyard and exterior conditions. This resulted in the creation of the “mat” structure. He had also ventured into using vertically and designed 3 unique structures that each had their own floor plans. Ultimately his goal was to mass spread these low-density and costly vertical structures that made use of vernacular elements throughout most of Casablanca. Unfortunately, his ideas did not fully come to fruition as a simple floor plan was created and mass replicated across the whole site while most of the buildings would eventually be redesigned and repurposed for other uses.\n\n\nThe project is the first mixed-use, affordable housing project in Los Angeles to employ this construction method.",

    "description": "Cidade de Deus, or “City of God,” began as a predefined, mass housing project built in Rio de Janeiro in the 1960s with the aim to promote economic growth and political reform in Latin America. The formerly sterile, uniform layout has informally grown over the span of multiple decades to accommodate a growing population, activating the spaces between and around the original housing units and apartment blocks. The informal construction undertaken by its citizens has generated a heterogeneous structure that, although it is recognizable as a whole, is composed of hyper-specific, continuously transforming space. Rather than creating specific structures to mold into specific categories, an open catalog of construction technologies, production modes, financial means, programmatic evolution, popular aesthetics, etc., has been and is being employed on a regular basis to conscientiously evolve with Cidade de Deus’s residents.\n\n\nAlthough this basis of the city was composed of similar housing and apartment units arranged in neat rows and blocks, they are now barely recognizable — or even visible — within the informally built extensions. Originally, 3,053 units were built to house a planned 10,000 people. Because the initial structures were not properly suited towards holding this many citizens, much less acting as collective housing, Cidade de Deus’s residents modified their spatial configuration on their own. They filled in the space between the early housing units with layered commercial and social spaces and structures and transformed the single family homes into multi-story, multi-generational ones, eventually building the city into one of the most famous favelas and urban sub-centers of Rio de Janeiro.",

    "description": "The Dymaxion House by Buckminster Fuller was a conceptual project for future housing based on the idea of dynamic, maximum and tension. Fuller is seeking a new method to redesign a dwelling that is adaptable in spaces, and to provide the maximum spaces under the consideration of transportability. The plan of the Dymaxion House is organized with a triangular grid and the furniture is designed based on the triangular form. Besides, the triangle grid is used for dispersing the tension of the structure.\n\n\nThe mechanics of the house involved the use of tension and compression in a web system, which is similar to the idea of suspension bridge. The mast acted as circular support so that all the elements of the building were suspended from above and did not rest upon supports from below. All the mechanical equipment and the supporting system for roof and floor are contained in the mast. By assembling all the fixed elements for the house in the middle, create a maximum occupied space. And the mast avoids the additional supporting system by putting all the heavy equipment in the core. The ventilation is downdraft which reduces the dust in the house. After the air is drawn in from the air inlet to the mast, the central mast circulates the air into the roof and interior by the gaps in the floor panel. Thus the air could ventilate into the rooms from the hole on the floor.\n\n\nThe minimum use of material, the light-weight dwelling, and the self-sufficiency system of ventilation made the Dymaxion House considered also as a sustainable dwelling.",

This multipurpose complex acts as an important landmark demarking the boundaries of different city districts. The complex contains residential, commercial and public service spaces that help create such dynamic relationships between it and the surrounding area. One of it’s public service uses is an entire floor dedicated to a tram depot that public transportation can utilize for seamless transitions between the two cities. Above this tram depot, there is a courtyard that is accessible by the public which contains various places in which people can just relax, taking them out of the busyness of the street. Also, since it is on such an important position between two cities and contains a tram depot, the outside perimeter acts as a huge commercial strip that contains commercial enterprises and restaurants creating a truly lively community in which a diverse group of people can all meet in a single complex. The building itself is a hybrid construction containing prefabricated wood elements on the façade and metal structural components as seen in the interior shots.",

    "description": "La Borda is a cooperative housing project in Barcelona developed in response to the region's housing shortage. The cooperative is built on land owned by the City Council, granted for 75 years for state-subsidized housing. This arrangement allowed local residents to collaborate with architects from Lacol and other consultants to establish a 28-unit sustainable housing complex. The community prioritized three core principles in its development--economic and environmental sustainability, cooperation through community participation, and the advancement of communal living.\n\n\nTo enhance sustainability, the project incorporates multi-purpose common areas to reduce the overall environmental footprint. The building is designed with a high number of south-facing units to maximize heat gain and lower energy costs. Additionally, a central atrium features operable openings that adjust to seasonal changes—promoting compactness in winter and openness in summer.\n\n\nAffordability and sustainability in communal housing require active and ongoing resident participation. From the outset, the project was shaped by the ideas of its residents, brought to life by architects and engineers. The initial phase included construction workshops, enabling the community to collectively apply their knowledge and skills to complete the building. The cooperative also emphasizes shared public spaces, centering them around a communal courtyard. While each resident has a private space, the courtyard fosters a sense of belonging by providing a shared, open environment that encourages interaction within the community. ",

    "description": "The six-story, 95,000 sf Star Apartments expands upon the “the idea providing permanent supportive housing within the downtown core of Los Angeles, specifically the Skid Row Housing.” The building is organized around “three principal spatial zones”, stacked one upon the other: a commercial/retail zone at street level; a second level for community programs; and four terraced floors of residences above.\n\n\nThe building design allows for a “recovery process” for homeless residents based on positive re-socialization, healthy interdependent relationships, and wellness. The project seeks to not only improve the quality of life for residents but to inspire a sense of pride, independence, and dignity.\n\n\nThis design focuses on creation of multiple terraces for communal activities maximising air flow and sunlight. This indoor/outdoor solid/void relationship that it creates plays well against the density and urbanism in downtown Los Angeles.\n\n\nThe LEED for Homes Platinum development was constructed with “prefabricated modular housing units that are cantilevered” on a 2 story concrete superstructure. Individual apartment units were built off-site using prefabricated materials and delivered to the project site and craned into place on the structural podium. These units are spacious and designed to promote independent and healthy living. Individual studio apartments include an eat-in kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom.\n\n\nAs the project had limited budget, the design team used prefabricated modules which were lifted into place over a new structural podium (acting at times like a courtyard). By doing so they were able to meet tighter construction tolerances and sustainability goals while increasing not only the construction quality, but also the quality of living.\n\n\nThe project is the first mixed-use, affordable housing project in Los Angeles to employ this construction method.",
